# Accelerometer Based Arduino Robot
An **Arduino** robot controlled by the Accelerometer reading from Android

## Roadmap
* Making an android app able to sense the Accelerometer data from an android mobile phone
* Bulding a working android app able to transmit data to an Arduino Board via Bluetooth Module (HC-05)
* Analyze the recorded accelerometer data for further processing for getting the almost accurate direction that robot should go

## Current Progress
* Android app able to sense accelerometer data ---> [done]

* Android app able to send data from android set to an arduino board via HC-05 ---> [under progress]
* Design a mathematical function able to classify the data --> [future work]
